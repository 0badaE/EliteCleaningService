My Second paid client, 
It is a simple front-end app made to show the client what the company is all about

I've attached a email form in the website using an HTML tool called formsubmit
it allows the user to email the business owner without having the owner's email

I built on top of a teamplate online, I figured since the site was so simple,
there was no need to load it up with features. 

fun little project and putting myself in a position where I am working 
professionally with clients. Crazy to think I started this 6-7 months ago!

It was my first time working with google domains. I took care of purchasing the site
and hosting everything. Linked the project with a host called netlify, the project is 
linked with the host, so we can make changes from github and they'll immediately apply!
